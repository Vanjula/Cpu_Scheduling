Efficient CPU scheduling is vital for optimizing performance and ensuring fair resource allocation in operating systems. 
To address these challenges, our CPU Scheduling Algorithm System, developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, offers a comprehensive solution. 
This system supports the implementation and visualization of four fundamental CPU scheduling algorithms: First Come First Served (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF), and Round-Robin.
